# Item 11 - Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones.

The author suggests to use deleted functions(C++11) in place of private undefined ones(C++98) for the following reasons:

* Error caught at compile time instead of link time.
* Can use it for all functions instead of only class member functions
* Can be used also in template instantiations.

## Catch error at Compile Time

To make a copy assignment operator to be not usable, C++98 declares those functions as private. If any friends or member functions, try to
access this operator, then the linking will fail.
```c++
//C++98
template <class charT, class traits = char_traits<charT> >
class basic_ios : public ios_base {
public:
…
private:
  basic_ios(const basic_ios& ); // not defined
  basic_ios& operator=(const basic_ios&); // not defined
};
```

In C++11, this is achieved by using `= delete`. In this case, the compilation will fail. This is an improvement as we catch the problem during compilation and not linking like in the case of C++98.

```c++

template <class charT, class traits = char_traits<charT> >
class basic_ios : public ios_base {
public:
…
  basic_ios(const basic_ios&) = delete;
  basic_ios& operator=(const basic_ios&) = delete;
…
};

```

## Delete all functions

By convention, in C++11, deleted functions are declared `public` as the author claims that it leads to better error messages in most compilers. This is because the compilers check visibility before 'delete' status of the called functions.

Advantage of using delete function is that any function can be deleted.

```c++
bool isLucky(int number); // original function

//non-sensical to check luck of a character, boolean, and a double/float
if (isLucky('a')) … 
if (isLucky(true)) … 
if (isLucky(3.5)) … 
```

The above lines of code may compile even though they don't make sense  because C++ tries to convert everything to `int`. To prevent this, we can use delete.

```
bool isLucky(int number); // original function
bool isLucky(char) = delete; // reject chars
bool isLucky(bool) = delete; // reject bools
bool isLucky(double) = delete; // reject doubles and floats

if (isLucky('a')) … // error! call to deleted function
if (isLucky(true)) … // error!
if (isLucky(3.5f)) … // error!
```

## Use in template instantiations
You can also use it to prevent template instantiations to un-intended types(`void*` and `char*` for instance).

```c++

template<typename T>
void processPointer(T* ptr);

template<>
void processPointer<void>(void*) = delete;
template<>
void processPointer<char>(char*) = delete;
template<>
void processPointer<const void>(const void*) = delete;
template<>
void processPointer<const char>(const char*) = delete;

```

If we want to do it for function templates inside a class, in C++ 98, you would do it the following way.
```c++
//C++98 way,
class Widget {
public:
…
template<typename T>
void processPointer(T* ptr)
{ 
  … 
}
private:
  template<> // error!
  void processPointer<void>(void*);
};
```
The above code snippet does not compile because different access level for specialization not allowed.

In C++11, you would do it the follwing way:

```c++
class Widget {
public:
…
template<typename T>
void processPointer(T* ptr)
{ 
  … 
}
…
};
template<>                                         // still
void Widget::processPointer<void>(void*) = delete; // public,
                                                   // but
                                                   // deleted
```

In this case, the compiler does not throw an error because in this case, you don't need a different access level for a specialization.
