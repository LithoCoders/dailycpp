# std::shared_ptr usage

With `std::shared_ptr`, clients need not to concern with managing life-time of *pointed-to* objects (as garbage collector). Beside, the timing of the objects' destruction is deterministic.

* Using a shared pointer is like a normal raw pointer
* *Reference count* is how a shared pointer knows if it is the last one pointing to an object.

```c++
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> sp1 = std::make_shared<int>(1);
    std::shared_ptr<int> sp2 = std::make_shared<int>(2);
    std::cout << "use_count = " << sp1.use_count() << std::endl;
    sp2 = sp1;
    
    //dereference a shared pointer like a raw pointer
    std::cout << "*sp1= " << *sp1 << ", *sp2= " << *sp2 << std::endl;
    *sp1 += 1;
    std::cout << "*sp1= " << *sp1 << ", *sp2= " << *sp2 << std::endl;   
    
    //check number of pointers point to the same object
    if (sp1.use_count() == sp2.use_count())
        std::cout << "use_count = " << sp2.use_count() << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "something wrong" << std::endl;  
    
    return 0;
}
Start

use_count = 1
*sp1= 1, *sp2= 1
*sp1= 2, *sp2= 2
use_count = 2

0

Finish
```
**Reference count**
* Constructor increments *reference count*
* Destructor decrements *reference count*
* Copy assignment (as example above) also decrements *reference count* to object `int` of value 2 and increments *reference count* of object `int` of value 1.
* When `shared_ptr` see *reference count* is `0` after decrement, it destroy resource.
* Increment and decrement of a *reference count* must be atomic
* For `std::shared_ptr`: move constructors are faster than copy constructors; move assignments are faster than copy assignments. Because move operators seem not care about reference counts? So, "move when moveable, copy when otherwise"

# `shared_ptr` vs. `unique_ptr`
1. `shared_ptr`s are twice the size of a raw pointer because it stores
* a raw pointer to resource
* a raw pointer to reference count (but actually later we see it is a block of memory, called *control block*)

2. `shared_ptr`s are more flexible with custom deleter, compared to `unique_ptr`s.
This is because share pointers need defining custom deleter as input of cosntructor while unique pointers need to define custom deleter in template parameter.

```c++
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

struct Widget
{
    int a;
};

void makeLogEntry(Widget* pw)
{
    std::cout <<__PRETTY_FUNCTION__<< pw->a << std::endl;
}

void makeSpecialLogEntry(Widget *pw)
{
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << pw->a << std::endl;
}

auto customDeleter = [](Widget* pw)            //custom deleter writes log before destroying resource
                      {
                        makeLogEntry(pw);
                        delete pw;
                      };

auto customSpecialDeleter = [](Widget* pw)    //custom deleter with special logging
                      {
                        makeSpecialLogEntry(pw);
                        delete pw;
                      };
int main()
{
    std::unique_ptr<Widget, decltype(customDeleter)> 
                                  p(new Widget, customDeleter); // define type of deleter in template
    
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> sp1(new Widget, customDeleter);     // define type of custom deleter in ctor
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> sp2(new Widget, customSpecialDeleter);
    
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Widget>> vsp;  // vector of shared pointers not care about deleters
    vsp.push_back(sp1);
    vsp.push_back(sp2);
    return 0;
}

Start

void makeSpecialLogEntry(Widget*)0
void makeLogEntry(Widget*)0
void makeLogEntry(Widget*)0

0

Finish
```
As a result, we can have 
* A vector of shared pointers with different deleters. 
* Shared pointers can be reassigned, reset its deleter. 
* Passing a share pointer to a function, with different deleters.

# Control Block
There is a control block for each object managed by `std::shared_ptr`s. The control block contains:
* a reference count
* weak count (?)
* Other data: custom deleter, custom allocator, etc.

todo: ASCII_ize control block image.

When a shared pointer is created to the *same* object, no control block is created. So, when a control block is created ?
* `std::make_shared` (item 21) always creates a control block
* `std::shared_ptr` is created from `std::unique_ptr` and `std::auto_ptr` (`auto_ptr` in legacy code)
* `std::shared_ptr` is created from raw pointer

Thing goes wrong when multiple `std::shared_ptr`s is created from a raw pointer.
Assuming we have a raw pointer, thing is OK.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct Widget
{
    ~Widget()
    {
        std::cout << "Destroy.." ;
    }
};

int main()
{
    auto pw = new Widget;
    delete pw;   
    
    return 0;
}
Start

Destroy..

0

Finish
```
But when we introduce a `shared_ptr` from this raw pointer. We double delete it.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct Widget
{
    ~Widget()
    {
        std::cout << "Destroy.." ;
    }
};

int main()
{
    auto pw = new Widget;
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw1 (pw);
    delete pw;   
    
    return 0;
}

*** Error in `./prog.exe': double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x000000000227dc20 ***

```
Object `Widget` is delted twice, thus causes undefined behavior. See more in Chapter4/experiment.mk

When we comment out `delete pw`, it is OK.
```c++
int main()
{
    auto pw = new Widget;
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw1 (pw);
    //delete pw;       
    return 0;
}
Start

Destroy..

0

Finish
```
But when we have two `shared_ptr`s, thing does not go wrong as the book mentioned. According to the book, there are two *reference count* to the same object pointed by both `spw1` and `spw2`. Thus, causes undefined behavior.
```c++
int main()
{
    auto pw = new Widget;
    
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw1 (pw);
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw2 (pw); //it seems, two different share pointers
    
    return 0;
}
Start

Destroy..Destroy..

0

Finish
```
If undefined behavior happens as in the book, there are two advises:
* first, don't use raw pointer at the first place. Use smart pointer
* second, don't make `shared_ptr` from a raw pointer. Instead, use `std::make_shared` (item 21) or use `new` and ctor to make second `shared_ptr`. Don't pass variable `pw` as above.
```c++
int main()
{
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw1 (new Widget);
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw2 (spw1);
    
    return 0;
}
Start

Destroy..

0

Finish
```
